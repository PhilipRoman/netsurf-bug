<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for any
other type of file is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the call is as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>pa</i>=<i>mmap</i>(<i>addr</i>,
<i>len</i>, <i>prot</i>, <i>flags</i>, <i>fildes</i>,
<i>off</i>);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>mmap</i>() function shall establish a mapping between the
address space of the process at an address <i>pa</i> for
<i>len</i> bytes to the memory object represented by the
file descriptor <i>fildes</i> at offset <i>off</i> for
<i>len</i> bytes. The value of <i>pa</i> is an
implementation-defined function of the parameter <i>addr</i>
and the values of <i>flags</i>, further described below. A
successful <i>mmap</i>() call shall return <i>pa</i> as its
result. The address range starting at <i>pa</i> and
continuing for <i>len</i> bytes shall be legitimate for the
possible (not necessarily current) address space of the
process. The range of bytes starting at <i>off</i> and
continuing for <i>len</i> bytes shall be legitimate for the
possible (not necessarily current) offsets in the memory
object represented by <i>fildes</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with
either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, the memory object to
be mapped shall be that portion of the typed memory object
allocated by the implementation as specified below. In this
case, if <i>off</i> is non-zero, the behavior of
<i>mmap</i>() is undefined. If <i>fildes</i> refers to a
valid typed memory object that is not accessible from the
calling process, <i>mmap</i>() shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The mapping
established by <i>mmap</i>() shall replace any previous
mappings for those whole pages containing any part of the
address space of the process starting at <i>pa</i> and
continuing for <i>len</i> bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the size of
the mapped file changes after the call to <i>mmap</i>() as a
result of some other operation on the mapped file, the
effect of references to portions of the mapped region that
correspond to added or removed portions of the file is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>len</i>
is zero, <i>mmap</i>() shall fail and no mapping shall be
established.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parameter
<i>prot</i> determines whether read, write, execute, or some
combination of accesses are permitted to the data being
mapped. The <i>prot</i> shall be either PROT_NONE or the
bitwise-inclusive OR of one or more of the other flags in
the following table, defined in the
<i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i> header.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-62321.png" alt="Image grohtml-62321.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">If an implementation cannot
support the combination of access types specified by
<i>prot</i>, the call to <i>mmap</i>() shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
implementation may permit accesses other than those
specified by <i>prot</i>; however, the implementation shall
not permit a write to succeed where PROT_WRITE has not been
set and shall not permit any access where PROT_NONE alone
has been set. The implementation shall support at least the
following values of <i>prot</i>: PROT_NONE, PROT_READ,
PROT_WRITE, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of PROT_READ and
PROT_WRITE. The file descriptor <i>fildes</i> shall have
been opened with read permission, regardless of the
protection options specified. If PROT_WRITE is specified,
the application shall ensure that it has opened the file
descriptor <i>fildes</i> with write permission unless
MAP_PRIVATE is specified in the <i>flags</i> parameter as
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parameter
<i>flags</i> provides other information about the handling
of the mapped data. The value of <i>flags</i> is the
bitwise-inclusive OR of these options, defined in
<i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i>:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-62322.png" alt="Image grohtml-62322.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">It is implementation-defined
whether MAP_FIXED shall be supported. MAP_FIXED shall be
supported on XSI-conformant systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">MAP_SHARED and
MAP_PRIVATE describe the disposition of write references to
the memory object. If MAP_SHARED is specified, write
references shall change the underlying object. If
MAP_PRIVATE is specified, modifications to the mapped data
by the calling process shall be visible only to the calling
process and shall not change the underlying object. It is
unspecified whether modifications to the underlying object
done after the MAP_PRIVATE mapping is established are
visible through the MAP_PRIVATE mapping. Either MAP_SHARED
or MAP_PRIVATE can be specified, but not both. The mapping
type is retained across <i>fork</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The state of
synchronization objects such as mutexes, semaphores,
barriers, and conditional variables placed in shared memory
mapped with MAP_SHARED becomes undefined when the last
region in any process containing the synchronization object
is unmapped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with
either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, <i>mmap</i>() shall,
if there are enough resources available, map <i>len</i>
bytes allocated from the corresponding typed memory object
which were not previously allocated to any process in any
processor that may access that typed memory object. If there
are not enough resources available, the function shall fail.
If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened
with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, these
allocated bytes shall be contiguous within the typed memory
object. If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object
opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, these
allocated bytes may be composed of non-contiguous fragments
within the typed memory object. If <i>fildes</i> represents
a typed memory object opened with neither the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag nor the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, <i>len</i> bytes starting at
offset <i>off</i> within the typed memory object are mapped,
exactly as when mapping a file or shared memory object. In
this case, if two processes map an area of typed memory
using the same <i>off</i> and <i>len</i> values and using
file descriptors that refer to the same memory pool (either
from the same port or from a different port), both processes
shall map the same region of storage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When MAP_FIXED
is set in the <i>flags</i> argument, the implementation is
informed that the value of <i>pa</i> shall be <i>addr</i>,
exactly. If MAP_FIXED is set, <i>mmap</i>() may return
MAP_FAILED and set <i>errno</i> to <b>[EINVAL]</b>. If a
MAP_FIXED request is successful, then any previous mappings
or memory locks for those whole pages containing any part of
the address range [<i>pa</i>,<i>pa</i>+<i>len</i>) shall be
removed, as if by an appropriate call to <i>munmap</i>(),
before the new mapping is established.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When MAP_FIXED
is not set, the implementation uses <i>addr</i> in an
implementation-defined manner to arrive at <i>pa</i>. The
<i>pa</i> so chosen shall be an area of the address space
that the implementation deems suitable for a mapping of
<i>len</i> bytes to the file. All implementations interpret
an <i>addr</i> value of 0 as granting the implementation
complete freedom in selecting <i>pa</i>, subject to
constraints described below. A non-zero value of <i>addr</i>
is taken to be a suggestion of a process address near which
the mapping should be placed. When the implementation
selects a value for <i>pa</i>, it never places a mapping at
address 0, nor does it replace any extant mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If MAP_FIXED is
specified and <i>addr</i> is non-zero, it shall have the
same remainder as the <i>off</i> parameter, modulo the page
size as returned by <i>sysconf</i>() when passed
_SC_PAGESIZE or _SC_PAGE_SIZE. The implementation may
require that off is a multiple of the page size. If
MAP_FIXED is specified, the implementation may require that
<i>addr</i> is a multiple of the page size. The system
performs mapping operations over whole pages. Thus, while
the parameter <i>len</i> need not meet a size or alignment
constraint, the system shall include, in any mapping
operation, any partial page specified by the address range
starting at <i>pa</i> and continuing for <i>len</i>
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system
shall always zero-fill any partial page at the end of an
object. Further, the system shall never write out any
modified portions of the last page of an object which are
beyond its end. References within the address range starting
at <i>pa</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes to whole
pages following the end of an object shall result in
delivery of a SIGBUS signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
implementation may generate SIGBUS signals when a reference
would cause an error in the mapped object, such as
out-of-space condition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>mmap</i>() function shall add an extra reference to the
file associated with the file descriptor <i>fildes</i> which
is not removed by a subsequent <i>close</i>() on that file
descriptor. This reference shall be removed when there are
no more mappings to the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last data
access timestamp of the mapped file may be marked for update
at any time between the <i>mmap</i>() call and the
corresponding <i>munmap</i>() call. The initial read or
write reference to a mapped region shall cause the
file&rsquo;s last data access timestamp to be marked for
update if it has not already been marked for update.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last data
modification and last file status change timestamps of a
file that is mapped with MAP_SHARED and PROT_WRITE shall be
marked for update at some point in the interval between a
write reference to the mapped region and the next call to
<i>msync</i>() with MS_ASYNC or MS_SYNC for that portion of
the file by any process. If there is no such call and if the
underlying file is modified as a result of a write
reference, then these timestamps shall be marked for update
at some time after the write reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There may be
implementation-defined limits on the number of memory
regions that can be mapped (per process or per system).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If such a limit
is imposed, whether the number of memory regions that can be
mapped by a process is decreased by the use of
<i>shmat</i>() is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>mmap</i>() fails for reasons other than <b>[EBADF]</b>,
<b>[EINVAL]</b>, or <b>[ENOTSUP]</b>, some of the mappings
in the address range starting at <i>addr</i> and continuing
for <i>len</i> bytes may have been unmapped.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion, the <i>mmap</i>() function shall return the
address at which the mapping was placed (<i>pa</i>);
otherwise, it shall return a value of MAP_FAILED and set
<i>errno</i> to indicate the error. The symbol MAP_FAILED is
defined in the <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i> header. No
successful return from <i>mmap</i>() shall return the value
MAP_FAILED.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">None.</p>

<h2>APPLICATION USAGE
<a name="APPLICATION USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of
<i>mmap</i>() may reduce the amount of memory available to
other memory allocation functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of
MAP_FIXED may result in unspecified behavior in further use
of <i>malloc</i>() and <i>shmat</i>(). The use of MAP_FIXED
is discouraged, as it may prevent an implementation from
making the most effective use of resources. Most
implementations require that <i>off</i> and <i>addr</i> are
multiples of the page size as returned by
<i>sysconf</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The application
must ensure correct synchronization when using <i>mmap</i>()
in conjunction with any other file access method, such as
<i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>(), standard input/output, and
<i>shmat</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>mmap</i>() function allows access to resources via
address space manipulations, instead of
<i>read</i>()/<i>write</i>(). Once a file is mapped, all a
process has to do to access it is use the data at the
address to which the file was mapped. So, using pseudo-code
to illustrate the way in which an existing program might be
changed to use <i>mmap</i>(), the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">fildes =
open(...) <br>
lseek(fildes, some_offset) <br>
read(fildes, buf, len) <br>
/* Use data in buf. */</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">becomes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">fildes =
open(...) <br>
address = mmap(0, len, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fildes,
some_offset) <br>
/* Use data at address. */</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After
considering several other alternatives, it was decided to
adopt the <i>mmap</i>() definition found in SVR4 for mapping
memory objects into process address spaces. The SVR4
definition is minimal, in that it describes only what has
been built, and what appears to be necessary for a general
and portable mapping facility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that while
<i>mmap</i>() was first designed for mapping files, it is
actually a general-purpose mapping facility. It can be used
to map any appropriate object, such as memory, files,
devices, and so on, into the address space of a process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a mapping
is established, it is possible that the implementation may
need to map more than is requested into the address space of
the process because of hardware requirements. An
application, however, cannot count on this behavior.
Implementations that do not use a paged architecture may
simply allocate a common memory region and return the
address of it; such implementations probably do not allocate
any more than is necessary. References past the end of the
requested area are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an
application requests a mapping that overlaps existing
mappings in the process, it might be desirable that an
implementation detect this and inform the application.
However, if the program specifies a fixed address mapping
(which requires some implementation knowledge to determine a
suitable address, if the function is supported at all), then
the program is presumed to be successfully managing its own
address space and should be trusted when it asks to map over
existing data structures. Furthermore, it is also desirable
to make as few system calls as possible, and it might be
considered onerous to require an <i>munmap</i>() before an
<i>mmap</i>() to the same address range. This volume of
POSIX.1-2017 specifies that the new mapping replaces any
existing mappings (implying an automatic <i>munmap</i>() on
the address range), following existing practice in this
regard. The standard developers also considered whether
there should be a way for new mappings to overlay existing
mappings, but found no existing practice for this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
expected that all hardware implementations are able to
support all combinations of permissions at all addresses.
Implementations are required to disallow write access to
mappings without write permission and to disallow access to
mappings without any access permission. Other than these
restrictions, implementations may allow access types other
than those requested by the application. For example, if the
application requests only PROT_WRITE, the implementation may
also allow read access. A call to <i>mmap</i>() fails if the
implementation cannot support allowing all the access
requested by the application. For example, some
implementations cannot support a request for both write
access and execute access simultaneously. All
implementations must support requests for no access, read
access, write access, and both read and write access.
Strictly conforming code must only rely on the required
checks. These restrictions allow for portability across a
wide range of hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The MAP_FIXED
address treatment is likely to fail for non-page-aligned
values and for certain architecture-dependent address
ranges. Conforming implementations cannot count on being
able to choose address values for MAP_FIXED without
utilizing non-portable, implementation-defined knowledge.
Nonetheless, MAP_FIXED is provided as a standard interface
conforming to existing practice for utilizing such knowledge
when it is available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, in
order to allow implementations that do not support virtual
addresses, support for directly specifying any mapping
addresses via MAP_FIXED is not required and thus a
conforming application may not count on it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The MAP_PRIVATE
function can be implemented efficiently when memory
protection hardware is available. When such hardware is not
available, implementations can implement such
&lsquo;&lsquo;mappings&rsquo;&rsquo; by simply making a real
copy of the relevant data into process private memory,
though this tends to behave similarly to <i>read</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The function
has been defined to allow for many different models of using
shared memory. However, all uses are not equally portable
across all machine architectures. In particular, the
<i>mmap</i>() function allows the system as well as the
application to specify the address at which to map a
specific region of a memory object. The most portable way to
use the function is always to let the system choose the
address, specifying NULL as the value for the argument
<i>addr</i> and not to specify MAP_FIXED.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If it is
intended that a particular region of a memory object be
mapped at the same address in a group of processes (on
machines where this is even possible), then MAP_FIXED can be
used to pass in the desired mapping address. The system can
still be used to choose the desired address if the first
such mapping is made without specifying MAP_FIXED, and then
the resulting mapping address can be passed to subsequent
processes for them to pass in via MAP_FIXED. The
availability of a specific address range cannot be
guaranteed, in general.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>mmap</i>() function can be used to map a region of memory
that is larger than the current size of the object. Memory
access within the mapping but beyond the current end of the
underlying objects may result in SIGBUS signals being sent
to the process. The reason for this is that the size of the
object can be manipulated by other processes and can change
at any moment. The implementation should tell the
application that a memory reference is outside the object
where this can be detected; otherwise, written data may be
lost and read data may not reflect actual data in the
object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
references beyond the end of the object do not extend the
object as the new end cannot be determined precisely by most
virtual memory hardware. Instead, the size can be directly
manipulated by <i>ftruncate</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Process memory
locking does apply to shared memory regions, and the
MCL_FUTURE argument to <i>mlockall</i>() can be relied upon
to cause new shared memory regions to be automatically
locked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Existing
implementations of <i>mmap</i>() return the value &minus;1
when unsuccessful. Since the casting of this value to type
<b>void *</b> cannot be guaranteed by the ISO&nbsp;C
standard to be distinct from a successful value, this volume
of POSIX.1-2017 defines the symbol MAP_FAILED, which a
conforming implementation does not return as the result of a
successful call.</p>
